🧠 Coders Of Delhi - Python Project
📋 Overview

This project explores data-driven insights and recommendations inspired by social network behavior. It demonstrates how Python and data science techniques can be used to build smart systems such as friend and page recommendations.

The work is organized across several Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a specific stage — from data exploration and cleaning to building intelligent suggestions.
