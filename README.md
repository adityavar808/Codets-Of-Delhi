🧠 Coders Of Delhi - Python Project
📋 Overview

This project explores data-driven insights and recommendations inspired by social network behavior. It demonstrates how Python and data science techniques can be used to build smart systems such as friend and page recommendations.

The work is organized across several Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a specific stage — from data exploration and cleaning to building intelligent suggestions.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Tools: Jupyter Notebook

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn (assumed)

Run each notebook in order to follow the workflow.

🧩 Notebooks Summary
Notebook	Description
1. Introduction.ipynb	Loads the dataset and performs basic exploratory analysis.
2. Data cleaning.ipynb	Handles missing values, duplicates, and data normalization.
3. People you may know.ipynb	Implements logic for recommending users based on mutual connections or similarity.
4. Pages you might like.ipynb	Suggests pages based on user interests and behavior patterns.
📈 Results

The project demonstrates how simple data-driven heuristics can create personalized user experiences.
Future versions could incorporate machine learning algorithms to enhance prediction accuracy.
